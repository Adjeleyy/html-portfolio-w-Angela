    <h1>My All-Time 'Worth-the-hype' movies/series</h1>
    <h2>Movies</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>1. Titanic</h3>
    <p>This movie was just the greatest invention of movies. You totally understand the dynamics of power play and the
        different classes of life.</p>
    <h3>2. Snow White and the Seven dwarves</h3>
    <p>I don't need to talk much, everyone has watched this, or at least knows the story haha. All i have to say is this
        is the movie that taught me about trust</p>
    <h3>3. Maharaja</h3>
    <p>My First Indian movie! And it did not disappoint at all. That plot twist, whew!</p>
    <h2>Series</h2>
    <h3>1. Suits</h3>
    <p>This series made me want to be a lawyer so bad. I was in love with Harvey Specter! hehe</p>

    <h3>2. Prison Break</h3>
    <p>Kept me on edge throughout the first two seasons esp. Honestly, I feel like they should have ended there</p>

    <h3>3. Big Bang Theory</h3>
    <p>This is just a comfort show to me. It keeps me company when i dont have anything to watch. Still hilarious
        though!</p>
